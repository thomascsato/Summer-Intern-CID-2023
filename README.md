# Summer-Intern-CID-2023

This repository includes all of the code written in R from my time interning as a Product Analyst at CID Bio-Science.  The code includes all the data transformations and code that was used to produce the visualizations.  All the M code used to create queries in Power BI are also included.

Also contained in this repository is results from various models built using TensorFlow, using spectroscopic wavelength data to predict dry matter content of avocados.
